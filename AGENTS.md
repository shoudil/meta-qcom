# Agent Guide for meta-qcom (wrynose / LTS branch)

This file guides automation agents to run builds / checks the same way CI does:

- use **kas-container** (isolated from host),
- keep `DL_DIR` and `SSTATE_DIR` outside the repo so caches are shared,
- run `yocto-patchreview` and `oe-selftest` routinely, and run
  `yocto-check-layer` before opening/updating a PR, via the CI helper scripts.

> **This is the `wrynose` LTS branch.** It is not the primary development
> branch. Changes are expected to land on **master** first and then be
> **backported** here with `git cherry-pick -x`, unless they are specific to
> `wrynose`. See [section 6](#6-pull-request--contribution-workflow-wrynose-lts)
> for the full workflow.

## Project Overview

meta-qcom is an OpenEmbedded / Yocto Project hardware enablement layer for Qualcomm based platforms.

`wrynose` is the **LTS Stable branch**, focused on long term support and
compatibility with the most recent Yocto Project LTS release. `master` is the
primary development branch.

## 1) Prerequisites

1. `kas-container` available on PATH, or set `KAS_CONTAINER=/abs/path/to/kas-container`
   (from [kas-container](https://github.com/siemens/kas/blob/master/kas-container)).
2. Container runtime access (Docker/Podman backend used by `kas-container`).
3. Work directories outside the repository for build outputs and shared caches.

### Container runtime smoke test (required order)

Run Docker first:

```sh
docker run --rm hello-world
```

Then check Podman:

```sh
if command -v podman >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  podman run --rm hello-world
else
  echo "podman not installed; continue with Docker backend"
fi
```

Notes:

- Do not use `sudo` unless the host setup explicitly requires it.
- Do not create or modify user groups as part of this workflow.
- If Podman is unavailable, Docker-only operation is acceptable.

## 2) Recommended environment

If `KAS_WORK_DIR`, `DL_DIR`, and `SSTATE_DIR` are already set in the environment, use them
directly — do not override them. Only set defaults when they are absent:

```sh
export REPO_DIR="$(pwd)"                               # meta-qcom checkout
export KAS_WORK_DIR="${KAS_WORK_DIR:-/path/to/kas-work}"      # outside repo to avoid polling the checkout
export DL_DIR="${DL_DIR:-/path/to/shared-cache/downloads}"
export SSTATE_DIR="${SSTATE_DIR:-/path/to/shared-cache/sstate-cache}"
mkdir -p "${DL_DIR}" "${SSTATE_DIR}" "${KAS_WORK_DIR}"
```

## 3) Build with kas-container (CI style)

CI build composition pattern:
`:ci/<machine>.yml[:distro.yml][:kernel.yml]`

Example:

```sh
export KAS_YAMLS="ci/rb3gen2-core-kit.yml:ci/qcom-distro.yml"
"${KAS_CONTAINER:-kas-container}" build "${KAS_YAMLS}"
```

## 4) Run routine checks via CI helper scripts

For routine local validation, run:

```sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/yocto-patchreview.sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/oe-selftest.sh
```

Run `yocto-check-layer` only before opening/updating a pull request:

```sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/yocto-check-layer.sh
```

### oe-selftest details

- Script: `ci/oe-selftest.sh`
- Auto-discovers tests in `lib/oeqa/selftest/cases/` when no test list is given.
- Honors `DL_DIR` and `SSTATE_DIR` from environment (recommended for shared cache).

Run a subset:

```sh
"${KAS_CONTAINER:-kas-container}" shell ci/base.yml \
  --command "/repo/ci/oe-selftest.sh /repo /work qcom_fitimage.QcomFitImageMatrixTests"
```

If passing explicit tests directly (without helper), call:

```sh
ci/oe-selftest.sh "$REPO_DIR" "$KAS_WORK_DIR" qcom_fitimage.QcomFitImageMatrixTests
```

## 5) Direct kas shell alternative (no helper wrapper)

For one-off commands:

```sh
kas-container shell --skip repos_checkout ci/rb3gen2-core-kit.yml -c "bitbake <target>"
kas-container shell --skip repos_checkout ci/rb3gen2-core-kit.yml -c "oe-selftest --run-tests qcom_fitimage"
```

Use the helper scripts for CI parity whenever possible.

## 6) Pull request / contribution workflow (wrynose LTS)

`wrynose` is the LTS branch. **Propose changes against `master` first.**
We expect every change to be backported to `wrynose` unless it is specific to
`wrynose` (e.g. it does not apply to `master`, or `master` has diverged in a way
that makes the change meaningless there).

### Default path: backport from master

1. Land the change on **master** following the master workflow (fork, topic
   branch, rebase on latest upstream `master`, open a PR).
2. Once it is merged on `master`, backport the merged commit(s) to `wrynose`
   using **`git cherry-pick -x`** so the backport records the original commit
   hash in the message (`(cherry picked from commit <sha>)`):

   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   git checkout -b backport/<PR-or-topic>-to-wrynose origin/wrynose
   git cherry-pick -x <sha> [<sha> ...]      # -x records the source commit
   # resolve conflicts if any, keeping the change minimal and equivalent
   ```

3. Run the CI-equivalent checks (see below).
4. Open a GitHub pull request targeting **wrynose**. Follow the project's
   `[Backport wrynose]` subject convention seen in history (see section 7).
5. Use PR discussion for review iteration.

### Exception: wrynose-only changes

If the change **cannot** be submitted to `master` (it is specific to `wrynose`),
then submit it directly against `wrynose`, and **explain in the commit body and
PR description why it is wrynose-only** and not a backport. This mirrors the
`README.md` contribution guidance for the stable branch.

### Before opening/updating a wrynose PR

Run CI-equivalent checks in this order:

```sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/yocto-patchreview.sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/yocto-check-layer.sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/oe-selftest.sh
```

Important:

- Follow Yocto submission guidance referenced in README:
  [Preparing Changes for Submission](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev/contributor-guide/submit-changes.html#preparing-changes-for-submission)

## 7) Commit message best practices (project style)

For **backports**, preserve the original master commit message and metadata, and
keep the `cherry-pick -x` trailer intact. The branch convention is to prefix the
subject with `[Backport wrynose]`, as seen in recent history:

- `[Backport wrynose] iq-9075-evk: build sdcc feature DTs as overlays (#2463)`
- `[Backport wrynose] kgsl-dlkm: Update to v1.0.4 (#2409)`
- `[Backport wrynose] linux-qcom-6.18 : update to tag qcom-6.18.y-20260611 (#2447)`

The backported body should retain the original explanation and end with the
cherry-pick trailer that `git cherry-pick -x` adds:

```text
(cherry picked from commit <sha>)
```

For the underlying change style (when authoring on `master` before backporting,
or for wrynose-only changes), use the style seen in recent history:

- `component: imperative summary` (preferred when scoped), e.g.
  - `ci/qcom-distro: Include meta-dpdk layer`
  - `fit-dtb-compatible: drop SoC version suffixes from compatible strings`
  - `debug.yml: enable FTrace settings in kernel cmdline`
- Or concise imperative summary when cross-cutting, e.g.
  - `Drop SoC version suffixes from FIT DTB compatible strings`

Every commit **must** include a `Signed-off-by` trailer using the identity from
the local git configuration:

```sh
git commit -s   # or pass --signoff; fetches user.name / user.email from git config
```

`git cherry-pick` preserves the original author's `Signed-off-by`; add your own
with `git cherry-pick -s` if your workflow requires it. If committing
programmatically, append the trailer explicitly:

```text
Signed-off-by: $(git config user.name) <$(git config user.email)>
```

Never fabricate a name or email; always read from `git config`.

Guidelines:

- Keep subject line short and specific; capture intent, not a file-by-file dump.
- Use imperative mood (`Add`, `Update`, `Drop`, `Enable`, `Revert`).
- Add a body for non-trivial changes explaining **why** and key design decisions.
- Wrap body lines for readability (~72 chars).
- Use consistent recipe bump wording for version updates, e.g.
  `recipe-name: upgrade vX.Y.Z -> vA.B.C`.
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in one commit; split logically.
- Each patch must be logically coherent, self-contained, and independently buildable.
- The tree must remain in a functional state after every commit.
- Fixups within the same patch series are not allowed; changes should be corrected in the patch where they are introduced.
